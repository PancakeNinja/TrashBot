## Welcome to TRASH-Bot's Page!

TRASH-Bot is basically a GPT2-medium model fine-tuned on English Light Novel Titles!

# The Model

The model itself can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/Fabby/gpt2-english-light-novel-titles/tree/main)!

# The Program

Before you download the program, read the disclaimer!

DISCLAIMER: The generator is a 1.6GB .exe tested on Windows 10, that's it. I never designed it to be publicly released originally.
The user interface is not influenced by resizing the window for example. If you feel uncomfortable with downloading an .exe that is 1.6GB in size, I can completely understand that. **Normally** you'd do all the "heavy lifting" on a server and have users (you) interact with a website instead. **If** people really want TrashBot to be an online service that they can play around with in their browser instead of downloading a big .exe that contains the entire AI-model, let me know on Twitter.

If you execute the program, a terminal window will open and you will see it unpacking a lot of stuff into a temporary folder (which deletes itself once you close the program.). I kept that in __intentionally__ so users can see that the program is currently in start-up mode (and I couldn't be arsed to replace it with a simple loading bar, gome!).
The initial start-up will take around 30-60 seconds, depending on your computer.

Again, if you have any questions, feel free to message me and I will try to answer them!

The .exe can be downloaded [here](https://mega.nz/folder/BCZE3bxT#UbxrxNt4BfOheOQ2rLNRiA)!

# The Source Code

I will upload the source code to a Github repository once I cleaned it up a bit and made it easier to use with a terminal. You know what they say... _it works on my machine_
